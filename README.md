# myCRED-without-freemius
myCRED cleaned from Freemius

I removed the freemius integration (added in version 2.0) which I liken to spyware. If it was data collected by myCRED itself all by itself, I might have given it a pass but involving an unknown third party without letting us know beforehand is a big no, no for me.

The new cashCRED functionality is kept on.

The removal of the interest payouts functionality will be carried on and will not be reversed.
